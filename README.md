Frozen Dread is an Unreal Engine 5 first person horror game that is built entirely in C++. Blueprints are only used for connecting asset references.

All game mechanics, systems, UI logic, and level scripting is implemented entirely in C++.

Game art (3D assets for models, animations, textures, and level design) were taken from the [Unreal Engine marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store), as this is a programming portfolio project.
